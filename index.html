    <p>
    
      I am a financial analyst with a background in banking and healthcare. 
      My Excel skills are self-taught while skills in VBA, Python, and SQL 
      were acquired from UCI where I earned a certificate in data analytics 
      and visualization. I comfortably navigate through large datasets and 
      transform them into meaningful and digestible content. I enjoy sharing 
      my knowledge where possible and building on top of my current skills 
      with every project I approach. My analytical problem-solving abilities, 
      combined with strengths in creating dashboards for diverse audiences, 
      make me a valuable addition to any team. 
      <h4>I am always happy to help. </h4>
